Project 1 Phase 2 Additions

Added Missile
The missile is a slow moving projectile that can be shot with e.
If the player is in the explosion radius, it will do damage to the player.
If a missile hits a rock, it will stop smaller rocks from spawning.

Added power up.
Power up has a 1/4 chance to spawn after a rock blows up.
THe power up gives the player infinite blaster fire rate for 3 seconds and allows for missiles to be shot twice as often.

Added boss ememy.
Boss enemy is a larger version of the regular enemy.
The boss enemy is immune to laser fire. It must be killed by two missile hits.
The boss enemy shoots in bursts of 6.

Added the bad rock.
Bad rocks are red rocks.
When hitting a bad rock, an enemy will spawn.
The bad rock has a 1/8 chance of spawning.

Project 2

[Project 2 Phase 1](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/WCU-CS-CooperLab/demo-games-The-Engma/blob/Project-2/Project%202%20Phase%201/index.html)

[Project 2 Phase 2](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/WCU-CS-CooperLab/demo-games-The-Engma/blob/Project-2/Project%202%20Phase%202/Index.html)

Project 2 Phase 1: Use W, A, S, and D to controll the camera. Left Click to bring up the power bar. Click again when you have the power you want to shoot.

Project 2 Phase 2:
Element 1: The arrow now moves around the y axis along with the x axis, meaning the ball can be shot up into the air in 3d space.

Element 2: There are several physics changing blocks that alter the ball. They are:

Blue block: The blue block makes the ball go into zero gravity when the ball comes into contact with it.
It also makes the ball shoot much further and has dampening. The ball is also bouncy.

Red Block: This block makes the ball have super gravity when the ball comes into contact with it. 
It is almost always a bad thing to have super gravity so avoid these blocks.

Purple Block: This block makes the ball have antigravity when it comes into contact with it.
The ball will "fall" up instead of down.

White block: The white block returns the balls physics back to normal when the ball comes into contact with it.

Element 3: Space Theme
The game is called Space Golf, and the skybox has been changed to a copyright free picture from NASA.
Special blocks have emissions turned on to make the game feel more futuristic.
It also helps them stand out more.
The golf course tiles themselves have not been changed. It is still golf afterall.

Element 4: Title Screen: There is now a title screen that allows for repeat playthroughs when finishing the game.

Phase 2 Elements:
Added Speed Ring (purple ring)
The speed ring increases the player forward speed depending on how close to the center of the ring the player gets.
The player also gets fuel depending on how close to the center they get.
Also added player speed in the UI

Added Bonus Ring (gold ring)
The player gets a score boost depending on how much extra speed they have when entering a bounus ring. The more speed
the player has, the more points they get.
The player recieves a fuel top up when they enter this ring.

Added Ghost Ring (translucent white ring)
Ghost ring turns the plane ghostly white and disables collision for a while.
The player recieves a fuel top up when they enter this ring.

Added Inverted Ring (pink ring)
When the player flies through the pink ring, their controlls are inverted.
While controlls are inverted, the player gets a 3x multiplier to their score.
The player recieves a fuel top up when they enter this ring.
Inverted controlls can be reverted by flying into another pink ring.

Added Bad Ring (red ring)
The bad ring takes away points and fuel depending on how close to the center the player gets.
The closer to the center of the ring, the more points and fuel the player looses.
If the player's controlls are inverted, the player recieves one third of the point and fuel loss.
